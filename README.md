# gRPCbb: Enhancing Large Message Handling in gRPC

## Abstract

gRPCbb (pronounced "gRPC BigBuffer") is an extension of the gRPC protocol that allows efficient transfer of messages of any size while minimizing the impact on performance. This paper describes the structure of messages in gRPCbb and how they are managed to optimize the transmission of large data.

## Introduction

The gRPC protocol is used for communication between distributed applications. However, its ability to efficiently transmit large messages can be limited. gRPCbb addresses this limitation by enabling the transfer of large messages while maintaining optimal performance.

## Messages in gRPCbb

A message in gRPCbb is defined using a protobuf message, which includes several key attributes for efficient data transmission:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package buffer;

message Empty {}

message Buffer  {
    message Head {
        message Partition {
            map<int32, Partition> index = 1;
        }
        int32 index = 1;
        repeated Partition partitions = 2;
    }
    message Block {
        message Hash {
            bytes type = 1;
            bytes value = 2;
        }
        repeated Hash hashes = 1;
        repeated uint64 previous_lengths_position = 2;
    }
    optional bytes chunk = 1;
    optional bool separator = 2;
    optional bool signal = 3;
    optional Head head = 4;
    optional Block block = 5;
}

```

### Structure of a Buffer Message

- **chunk**: A message is divided into one or more fragments, each represented by a `chunk` attribute. Receivers must accumulate these fragments until they encounter a message with the `separator` attribute activated, indicating the end of the current message.
- **signal**: This attribute allows the receiver to inform the sender that it can temporarily stop sending Buffers. This prevents the receiver from storing the buffer in memory if it does not need it at that moment. When the sender receives a Buffer with the `signal` active, it can resume sending.
- **head**: The `head` attribute is used to specify the message's index and define the message's partition. The message index allows the same gRPC method to receive different objects identified by indices in its input and output. This facilitates interoperability between different objects within a single gRPC method.
- **block**: A block is a subset of the buffer associated with a hash identifier. It allows the receiver to request that the sender skip the transmission of certain parts of the buffer if it already has that data.

## Using Blocks (Buffer Containers)

Blocks are a fundamental feature of gRPCbb for efficient management of large messages:

1. When the receiver receives a Buffer with the `block` attribute, a list of block identifiers and a list of indices of the Protobuf lengths affected by the block are defined.
2. The receiver checks if it already has the buffer on disk. If so, it can skip the transfer of that data.
3. The receiver returns a Buffer to the sender with the same block.
4. The sender receives the block and stops sending it, indicating to the receiver that subsequent Buffers are no longer part of the block.
5. The receiver waits to receive that block again to continue accumulating data and paying attention to the content of the following Buffers.

### Nested Blocks

It is possible to incorporate blocks within blocks, allowing for finer granularity in data management and transmission optimization.

## Conclusion

gRPCbb (pronounced "gRPC BigBuffer") is an extension of the gRPC protocol that enables efficient transfer of messages of any size while maintaining optimal performance. By dividing messages into fragments, using signals, and allowing block management, this extension becomes a valuable tool for applications that require efficient transfer of large data. Its ability to adapt to different indices facilitates interoperability between objects within a single gRPC method, making it a versatile solution for distributed applications.
